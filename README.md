# 🚀 From Claims to Clarity: Transforming Insurance Data & Customer Voices into Actionable Insights with Power BI

✨ Imagine if insurance companies could understand both what's happening in their business and how their customers feel—all in one place.

🔍 That’s exactly what I set out to solve in my latest Power BI project: “Insurance Analytics & Sentiment Insights” for Prism Insurance Pvt. Ltd.


📊 What I Built:

  A two-part dynamic dashboard experience:
  
    1. Insurance Overview Dashboard
  
    2. Customer Feedback Sentiment Dashboard

  The datasets were hosted in MS SQL, and Power BI was used to design intuitive visuals. Features like Row-Level Security (RLS), Scheduled Refresh, Drill through, and AI Word Cloud were implemented for dynamic   
  reporting.


🔎Questions Answered by this Dashboard:

    1. Which age group has the highest claim amount?
    
    2. What is the claim status distribution across policy types?
    
    3. What’s the premium performance by policy category?
    
    4. How many policies are currently active vs inactive?
    
    5. What’s the gender-wise split of customers?
    
    6. What keywords are most common in customer feedback?
    
    7. How do individual feedbacks translate into sentiment scores?
    
    8. How many customers fall into each sentiment category?
    
    9. What kind of feedback relates to high vs low sentiment?
    

Key Insights:

    👥 Gender distribution is balanced (Female: 5001, Male: 5003).
    
    💼 Travel insurance contributes the highest to the overall premium revenue.
    
    🛑 The majority of claims are rejected (4.4K), followed by settled and pending.
    
    📈 Adults generate the highest claim amounts compared to other age groups.
    
    ✅ 58.13% policies are active, suggesting strong ongoing customer engagement.
    
    🔠 Used AI Word Cloud Visual for textual insights.
    
    🤖 Performed sentiment scoring to classify customer feedback into:
    
    	-Excellent
    
    	-Good
    
    	-Need Improvement
    
    📉 Identified common negative sentiment themes like “unclear policies” and “billing issues.”
    
    📈 Positive feedback highlights fast claim settlements and good customer service.

  and deliver better experiences.
